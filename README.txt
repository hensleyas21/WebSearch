You can check your solution against mine by running the ProgLangSearch.jar file.
As you do so, please keep in mind that our results for PageRank in particular 
may differ since our algorithm is not deterministic. In order to run the 
provided executable jar file, you must navigate to the same directory as the 
file in your terminal and enter a command in the format listed below.

java -jar ProgLangSearch.jar (equal|indegree|pagerank) (count|frequency|tf-idf) (arithmetic|geometric|harmonic)

Example Commands:
    java -jar ProgLangSearch.jar equal count arithmetic
    java -jar ProgLangSearch.jar pagerank tf-idf geometric

If you are unable to get all the functions working for your project, you may 
write your report on the basis of the output of my solution, but you must note 
that you have used my solution and will not receive full credit.
